## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Astro structure:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── ...
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── pages/
│       └── ...
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page corresponds to a route based on its file name. Any static assets, like images, should be placed in the `public/` directory.
